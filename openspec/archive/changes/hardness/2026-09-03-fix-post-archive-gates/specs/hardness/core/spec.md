## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Retained Hardness performance evidence

Hardness SHALL expose one performance-test profile that measures fresh-process and persistent-session harness paths independently in Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7. Every sample MUST also validate the invoked behavior. Each run MUST write a unique structured summary and raw sample table without overwriting or automatically deleting prior runs, while the change record retains a privacy-trimmed aggregate baseline and hashes of its raw source artifacts. Default TaskStatus sampling MUST use a hermetic temporary Task Graph that does not depend on an active project change; an explicit `-TaskChange` MAY select an active project record intentionally.

#### Scenario: Record a two-host performance run
- **WHEN** the Performance profile runs for both supported PowerShell hosts
- **THEN** each host reports its own warmup count, measured samples, min/median/p95/max, behavior result, and broad catastrophe-budget result in one unique Saved run directory

#### Scenario: Preserve comparable evidence without a flaky machine gate
- **WHEN** one accepted run is registered as the current baseline
- **THEN** raw machine-specific samples remain ignored local data, a trimmed aggregate is indexed under change attachments before archive, and a single prior-run regression ratio remains advisory until representative history establishes a portable threshold

#### Scenario: Run without an active project change
- **WHEN** the default Performance profile runs after every project change has been archived
- **THEN** TaskStatus measures the real Hardness/OpenSpec route against an isolated temporary Task Graph and removes that fixture after the run

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Archive-stable closure gates

Reusable gates cited as closure evidence MUST use hermetic fixtures or stable repository inputs and MUST NOT require the subject record to remain under `openspec/changes/`. A default gate that needs a schedulable Task DAG MUST create a hermetic active fixture. An explicit `-TaskChange` MUST resolve the selected active record or fail without falling back to an archive. A historical protocol audit MAY bind an exact immutable archive path, but archived tasks MUST NOT become `task.status` scheduling input. After a deterministic archive move, the coordinator MUST run strict archived validation plus the smallest applicable non-destructive lifecycle gate that can expose active-path coupling. A newly exposed defect MUST use a follow-up change and MUST NOT rewrite the completed archive.

#### Scenario: Detect active-path coupling after archive
- **WHEN** an applicable gate fails only after its subject change moves to the archive
- **THEN** the archive remains immutable while a follow-up change records the failure, repair, review, and replacement evidence

#### Scenario: Retain accepted evidence before archive
- **WHEN** a performance run is accepted as closure evidence
- **THEN** its privacy-trimmed aggregate and raw-artifact hashes are indexed in the active change before the archive move

#### Scenario: Select an explicit active Task Graph
- **WHEN** a caller passes `-TaskChange` for a missing or archived record
- **THEN** the gate fails that explicit selection and does not silently substitute a fixture or historical Task DAG

#### Scenario: Audit immutable protocol history
- **WHEN** a reusable protocol test intentionally checks the completed dogfood Review/Replan history
- **THEN** it reads the exact immutable archive path without treating that record as current execution state
